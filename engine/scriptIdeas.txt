var - creates a new variable but in-engine these are all set to engine_var to avoid name conflicts
text - adds a new text line, may require ""
bg - sets a new background, 
map - sets new map, maps are tile based and each tile represents a background so as the player moves new backgrounds will automatically be loaded.

    spr delete slot# - deletes that sprite on screen
slot# - references a spr slot. spr can be assigned a set of variables which are referenced by the slot they are in and a . (ex slot1.attack)

EXAMPLE:
map castle // Looks for a map in the map folder named castle and loads all the images into memory from the bg/castle folder
cmd Fireball // really just a bool, is set to 1 if a textinput matches
var fireballDmg = 5 // is created as engine_fireballDmg in the backend to avoid duplicate names

if bg castle3
    spr goblin slot1
    text "A Goblin appears!"
endif

if cmd Fireball
    if slot1
        slot1.hp - fireballDmg
    endif
endif

if slot1.hp = 0
    spr delete slot1
    text "Goblin defeated!"
endif
